These are my Trees that I implemented in my version.

<h1>BST </h1>
<hr>
<i> <br> A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure used for organizing data in a hierarchical order. It is composed of nodes where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. 
The key property of a BST is that for any given node, all elements in its left subtree are less than its value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than its value. </i>

<hr>
<b>
This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n) on average, 
making it useful for tasks like dictionary implementations and data sorting.
</b>
<hr>

If you want to compile my codes.
You must write

```
g++ -std=c++2a main.cpp

```

and then if you want to run them you must write

```
./a.out 

```

<h1>General Tree </h1>
<hr>
<i> <br> 
A general tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node can have an arbitrary number of children. Unlike binary trees, which have at most two children per node, a general tree allows nodes to have multiple children, forming a branching structure. 
The node at the top of the hierarchy is called the root, and each node in the tree may have zero or more child nodes. Nodes with no children are often referred to as leaves.
</i>

<hr>
<b>
General trees are versatile and can model a wide range of hierarchical relationships in various applications, such as file systems, organizational structures, or representing hierarchical data in computer science and information systems. 
The structure of a general tree is not limited to a fixed number of branches, providing flexibility for modeling complex relationships.
